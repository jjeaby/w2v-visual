== 개요 ==
[[Maroon 5]]의 다섯 번째 싱글곡. 래퍼 [[위즈 칼리파]]가 피처링했다. 2012년 4월 17일에 [[Maroon 5]]의 네 번째 음반 [[Overexposed]]와 함께 발매되어 미국에서 500만 장 이상, 한국에서 200만 장 이상이 팔렸다.

가장 먼저 싱글로 공개됐으며, 앨범 수록곡 중 가장 대중들의 반응이 좋은 곡이었다. 그럼에도 불구하고 결국 빌보드 핫 100에서 꾸준히 2위에 머물며 결국 1위를 차지하진 못했다. 당시 [[칼리 레이 젭슨]]의 <[[Call Me Maybe(음반)|Call Me Maybe]]>가 압도적인 인기를 누리고 있었기 때문.

== 가사 ==
||I’m at a pay phone trying to call home, all of my change I spent on you

Where have the times gone, baby it’s all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

Yeah, I, I know it’s hard to remember, the people we used to be

It’s even harder to picture that you’re not here next to me

You say it’s too late to make it, but is it too late to try

And in that time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down

I’ve wasted my nights, you turned out the lights, now I’m paralyzed, still stuck in that time, when we called it love, but even the sun sets in paradise

I’m at a pay phone trying to call home, all of my change I spent on you

Where have the times gone, baby it’s all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist, I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit

One more fucking love song I’ll be sick

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow ‘cause you forgot yesterday

I gave you my love to borrow, but you just gave it away

You can’t expect me to be fine, I don’t expect you to care

I know I said it before, but all of our bridges burned down

I’ve wasted my nights, you turned out the lights, now I’m paralyzed, still stuck in that time, when we called it love, but even the sun sets in paradise

I’m at a pay phone trying to call home, all of my change I spent on you

Where have the times gone, baby it’s all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist, I would still be holding you like this

And all those fairy tales are full of shit

One more stupid love song I’ll be sick

Now I’m at a pay phone

(Wiz)

Man fuck that shit

I’ll be out spending all this money while you’re sittin’ around wondering around it wasn’t you who came up from nothin’

Made it from the bottom now when you see me I’m stuntin’

And all of my cars start with a push of a button

Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it

Switch the number to my phone so you never could call it

Don’t need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I’m ballin

Swish, what a shame could of got picked

Had a really good game but you missed your last shot, so you talk about who you see at the top or what you could of saw but sad to say it’s over for

Phantom pulled up valet open doors

Wished I’d go away got what you was lookin for

Now it’s me who they want so you can go and take that little piece of shit with you

(Adam)

Yeah, I’m at a pay phone trying to call home, all of my change I spent on you

Where have the times gone, baby it’s all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist, I would still be holding you like this

And all these fairy tales are full of shit

Yeah, one more stupid love song I’ll be sick

Now I'm at a payphone||
